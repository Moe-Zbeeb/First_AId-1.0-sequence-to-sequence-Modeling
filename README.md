### AI-Powered First Aid Assistance    
### Key Contribution  
At First AID, we take pride in our commitment to excellence in medical assistance. Unlike many other applications in the market, **we have meticulously developed our sequence model from scratch, ensuring that every aspect of its architecture is tailored specifically to the demands of first aid and emergency response**. By eschewing the common practice of fine-tuning pre-existing language models (LLMs), we eliminate any potential biases or limitations that might arise from pre-trained weights. This approach not only guarantees the highest level of accuracy and reliability but also underscores our unwavering dedication to the safety and well-being of our users. As pioneers in the field, we are proud to introduce one of the first fully dedicated FIRST AID apps, setting a new standard for accessible and intelligent medical assistance.
