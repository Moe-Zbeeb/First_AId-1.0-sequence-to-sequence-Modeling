### Key Contribution  
At First AID, we take pride in our commitment to excellence in medical assistance. Unlike many other applications in the market, **we have meticulously developed our sequence model #### from scratch ##### , ensuring that every aspect of its architecture is tailored specifically to the demands of first aid and emergency response**. By eschewing the common practice of fine-tuning pre-existing language models (LLMs), we eliminate any potential biases or **limitations that might arise from pre-trained weights**. This approach not only guarantees the highest level of accuracy and reliability but also underscores our unwavering dedication to the safety and well-being of our users. As pioneers in the field, **we are proud to introduce one of the first fully dedicated FIRST AID apps, setting a new standard for accessible and intelligent medical assistance**.     for example the model will **not give any pills' recommendations** or if it happens that the model is not confident about an answer it will never Hallucinate but instead will ask you to enter a better prompt.
##### Note : Model is proved to be better that prompt engineering basded on litreture for example prof ali chehab coducted a study about prompt engineering vs fine tuning (in totally different but proving the point)

#### Introduction

Artificial intelligence has become ubiquitous in our lives, so why not leverage it in emergencies and first aid applications? Introducing First AID, an application featuring a user-friendly GUI backed by a powerful sequence model trained specifically for first aid questions and emergency situations.

#### About First AID

First AID is not just another medical app; it's your virtual first responder. Powered by state-of-the-art AI algorithms, it provides real-time assistance and guidance during medical emergencies. Specially if  you're dealing with a minor injury(coughing,bleeding, or simple CUT) , First AID is there to help you make informed decisions.

#### How It Works

- **Seamless User Experience**: First AID boasts an intuitive interface designed for ease of use, ensuring that anyone, regardless of their medical expertise, can access its features.
- **Comprehensive Knowledge Base**: Behind the scenes, First AID harnesses the collective wisdom of medical literature, research papers, and real-world emergency scenarios to provide accurate and up-to-date information and all this is linked statisrically by robust Sequence Model to help you make informed decisions.
